## Welcome to my repo! My name is Kaleb and I am a student at the University of Missouri - Columbia.

### Here is a few things about me!

On a daily basis, I really enjoy the gym, running, going to the library, and food!

I also am in the Army ROTC program, and as I graduate next May, I am looking forward to a potential active duty career in the Army as a cyber lieutenant.
